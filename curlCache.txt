                           Curl Cache Notes
                      ----------------------------
Curl request
   put in ram disk
   multi-threading
      queue multiple for same file
   allow file://protocol
   callbacks during download
      check cache size at:
         start of download
         after header if size known
         on completion
         when writing file
      test for out-of-memory condition
   download first to RAM?
      out of memory checking
   cleanup after aborts (including 404 with content)
   cancel curl request (implies identifying the request)
   signature to validate
   time server to set clock?
      otherwise, each reboot starts anew and newest can 
      become oldest.
      Not such a problem if cache is cleared (RAM disk)



Calls into the 'cache'

The curl cache can be thought of as a mutex-protected 
shared memory blackboard, through which the application makes
mostly asynchronous calls (with call-backs for completion
status), and from which a set of curl worker threads
pulls requests and posts status values.

   Main application entry points
   -----------------------------
   get/put
         details of request
            url
            post parameters
         onprogress callback  - indicates forward movement
         onfilesize callback  - indicates file size is known
         oncomplete callback  - ref counted file ptr handed off here
         oncancel callback
         onfailure callback
         ondelete callback (used if no cache specified and file exists in cache)

   cancelLoad  - cancel a pending transfer
      all instances or just this request?
      oncancel callback

   deleteFile
      details of request
         url
         post params
      ondelete callback

   worker thread entry points
   --------------------------
   getRequest                 - called from reader thread
   completedRequest           - called from reader thread
   failedRequest              - called from reader thread
   cancelledRequest           - called from reader thread

      thread(s)                                                  thread(s)

                       and progress                  values

                                           |
                                           V
                                           
                                       disk cache


Data structure notes
   Cache consists of a handful of fairly separable things:

      1. Disk cache. This is entirely passive, synchronous, and
         controlled by the global curl cache lock.

         Called by application threads to
            clear some space for a pending transfer
            open a handle and mmap a cached item (when get is cached)
            close a handle and munmap a cached item
            delete an item from the persistent store
               (either synchronously in deleteFile call, or during
                handle close for deferred delete)

         Called by worker threads to
            delete some space to make room for incoming data
            store content of file

      2. Curl Active Entity cache
         Consists of an array of 'active' cache entries. These
         entries may not yet have a disk/ram cache entry (not until
         a successful retrieval), but have at least one of the following:

            - an active worker request 
            - one or more active application requests.
            - one or more open file descriptors

         Active cache entries are removed when the last reference to
         them is invalidated from the list above. Their disk/ram entry 
         may remain (until a 'delete' call is made)

      3. Worker request queue

         Simply a queue of file transfer requests to be performed. Each
         worker queue request is pointed to from its 'active' cache 
         entry. Active cache entries with an active worker request never
         have a corresponding disk cache entry.

      4. Application request list

         A set of application entries for each pending request. Pending
         here means the time between an initiating application call to
         the curl cache (get,put,delete) and the corresponding final completion 
         callback (oncomplete,onfailure,ondelete,oncancel). Note that 
         cancel is not an initiating call, since it requires an active
         entry, and does not generate an extra completion callback. Instead,
         it alters (if not too late) the completion callback to 'oncancel' 
         instead of 'oncomplete' or 'onfailure'.

      5. Application file handles

         These objects don't really live in the cache domain, but they are
         used to control reference counting to open file handles (and mmaps).
         Each of them has a pointer back to the Active Entity Cache

Use/case analysis

   app thread issues get request.
   if in cache and 'no cache' flag
      if file in use, wait for unused (asynchronous)
      when unused, delete and callback if needed
   if not in cache
      clear some space based upon file type
      add entry to curl cache
         entry in scoreboard, status pending get/post
      chain client request to cache entry (doubly-linked list)
      insert new worker request
      return client request identifier
   else (in cache)
      call any progress functions
         file size
         bytes read      
      call oncomplete

         ^                         /        |          1:0/1
         |                       /          |
         V                   ----           |
   next app req for file   /                |
                          /                 |
                         /                  |
   file handle   -------- 0/N:1             |
                                            | 1:0/1
                                            |
                                            V
                                        Disk Cache


I'm tempted to have file handles talk directly to the disk cache, but deferred
delete makes this more appropriate for the Active entity cache. Deferred delete
requires an application request entry, and if the file handle points to the 
disk cache, either the disk cache needs to point back to the active entity cache
or to a list of app requests, making life messy(er).

The reason I'm tempted to have the file handle point to the disk cache is because
the disk cache needs to know the reference count status (0/1-N) of each file when
determining what it can throw out. I can accomplish the same thing by just keeping 
the reference count in the disk cache data structure.

But wait, I also need a reference count in the active entity cache for use by 
objects with protocol file://.

So, I'll just place a flag (inUse/not) in the disk cache and keep the reference
count in the active entity cache.

Actually, I'll also put the file open/mmap calls into the disk cache to mask the
fact that there's header information in the cache'd files.


                        In-depth data structure descriptions:
                        -------------------------------------

Disk Cache
----------

The disk cache is a process-global object whose primary purpose is to keep track of
how much disk space is in use, and manage a set of objects occupying that space.
In normal operation, it is expected that the cache is always 'full', and that each
failed request for an item in the cache will be followed by a set of requests for 
space.

The disk cache is passed a directory to be used for storage, which is normally /tmp/curl,
but can be overridden by the environment variable 'CURLTMPDIR'. If the directory does
not exist, it will be created.

The disk cache has a fixed maximum size over its' lifetime. If the CURLTMPSIZE 
environment variable is defined at startup, it will be used to define the size. 
Otherwise, a default amount of space is used (see ccDiskCache.cpp for current default).

In order to allow mmap'd access to non-cached files (e.g. posts and CGI requests), they
are stored in the disk cache along with persistent files, but are flagged for deletion
when their reference count goes to zero. This requires that an application use and consume
the content immediately during the 'oncomplete' handler.

Worker Threads
--------------

On startup, some number of curl worker threads will be started and handed a queue of
curl requests. Each of them will repeatedly pull requests from the queue until the queue
says 'abort'.

At startup, a number of callbacks are installed for use by all worker threads. 

No references are made in the ccWorker module to the active entity or disk caches.
This should happen inside the callbacks passed to the curl worker thread initialization
routine.

All of this allows the module to be developed and tested outside of the greater curl cache 
structure.
