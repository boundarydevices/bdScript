------------- Notes on Javascript wrappers for cURL ---------------------
There are a variety of cURL functions available to Javascript:
   curlGet()      - grabs a URL using http GET and returns the content
   curlPost()     - grabs a URL using http POST and returns the content


Each of these takes one or more parameters:
   url         - relative or absolute (http://) URL
   variables   - Any variables to be posted. Variable
                 names will be used as form variable names
                 for POSTs, or as part of the query string
                 for GETs

and each returns an object (array) with the following
members:
   worked   - boolean : meaning is obvious
   status   - HTTP status
   mimeType - mime type of retrieved file
   content  - String with the content of the URL
