/*
 * rollingMedian.h
 *
 * This header file declares the rollingMedian_t
 * class, which is used to calculate and produce
 * median-of-n values for a stream of input data.
 *
 * It does this by keeping two arrays of input data:
 *    a circular buffer in input order
 *    a sorted array of the last N points
 *
 * Note that this class is optimized for small (<20)
 * values of N. 
 *
 * It expects unsigned short inputs, and will produce
 * at most 1 output for each input. It won't produce
 * any outputs until N points have been fed to it.
 *
